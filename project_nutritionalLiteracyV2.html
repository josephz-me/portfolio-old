                            <p>Throughout our time at CMU, my team and I have noticed how students ill-equipped are to achieve a balance between health and academics. To intervene, we designed Carnegie Kitchen, a nutrition and wellness app for Carnegie Mellon students to increase practicality of on-campus dining while building positive outlooks on eating.</p><br><br>

                            <p>As second year CMU students who love food and prioritize our wellbeing, we wanted to better understand the lack of nutritional literacy among CMU students . Our curiosity lead to the question of:</p>
                            <br><br>
                            <i style='color:#47b46d;'>“How might we improve nutritional literacy among Carnegie Mellon students in regards to both on-campus and off-campus dining?”</i><br><br>
                            <!-- <p>
                                Throughout our time at CMU, we have noticed the lack of nutritional resources surrounding CMU’s dining options. There are a few CMU digital and physical platforms dedicated to promoting nutritional wellbeing (e.g. dining calendars, nutritional calculator, Health Services). While these resources exist, they are scattered across multiple platforms making it inconvenient to access them regularly.
                            <br><br>
                            As a result, students don’t take advantage of what CMU provides and are ill-equipped to achieve a balance between health and academics. Many are constantly stressed, unhappy, and unaware of how they can use food to improve their wellbeing.</p><br><br> -->

From doing so, we realized that some stakeholders don’t fit into a specific category and should be treated flexibly. Deepening our understanding of our stakeholders revealed to us the wide scope of participants in the CMU food ecosystem.</p>

Overall, the majority had misconceptions about what it meant to have a positive relationship with food. Furthermore, many students didn’t care about their nutrition and for those who did care, they felt a lot of negativity and guilt when it came to being “healthy”. Many responses revealed a common hyperfocus on specific measures of nutrition (e.g. protein levels, fats) rather than looking at nutrition from a holistic perspective.</p>

								<p>Through diary studies, my collaborators and I tracked what seven students ate everyday for a week.

Visually mapping the survey responses reaffirmed our finding that the most influential factors in how students decided on a dining option were location, convenience, and preference/taste.</p>

Many also felt like there weren’t enough cultural foods familiar to their background. All these frustrations contributed to an overall lack of trust in CMU Dining's ingredients and kitchen services.</p>

These three interviews played a massive role in the way we refined our approach to nutritional literacy. <br><br>By talking to to these individuals, we realized that nutritional literacy was so much more than just understanding the concept of micronutrients and macronutrients, that healthy eating was in reality extremely psychological.

                            <p>Over the next few days, my team and I asked 30 individuals to engage with our InVision prototype in various ways. We collected feedback in various ways including asking them to engage in timed tasks, explore the app freely, and to verbalize their joys and discomforts. Below are the five biggest takeaways we gathered from this experience.</p>

                                <h5>Overview</h5>
                                <p>From our user testing results, we developed our final app designs. In our final solution, we made sure to cater towards the wide spectrum of CMU students and their dietary needs.</p><br><br>
                                
                                <h5>Live Dining — Calendar</h5>
                                <p>The primary function for this app is the live dining calendar for on-campus restaurants. This already exists on CMU’s website as well as on a student-built site called CMU Eats, but the issue right now is a lot of valuable information on CMU dining is inaccessible because of how it is scattered across various digital services.<br><br>

                                <em>This feature is important to the app because it’s the practical feature that will keep students consistently using the app, and ultimately lead them explore our more behavior-changing features.</em> From this page, users are able to explore individual dining locations and view individual restaurant items.<br><br>
                                
                                <p>*After user testing, we included traffic tags that indicate population and traffic at each physical dining location. </p>

                                <h5>Live Dining — Nutrition Facts</h5>
                                <p>Viewing nutrition facts can contribute to obsessive nutrient tracking behaviors, so we implemented a precautionary barrier that requires users to watch an educational awareness video before accessing the nutrition facts.</p>

                                <h5>Living Dining - Preorder System</h5>
                                <p>One of the biggest priorities we found among students was convenience and time. Introducing a pre-order system addresses this concern and creates a more efficient, stress-free dining experience for students.<br><br>*After user testing, we displayed estimated wait times for potential pre-orders.</p>

                                <h5>Recipe Page</h5>
                                <p>For people who sometimes or fully eat off-campus, we designed a recipe viewing and sharing aspect. <em>We were really careful, however, about not creating a social media platform where the number of likes influenced an user’s emotional state. After user testing though, we did find that some sort of feedback about the reliability of recipes was extremely important.</em> Rather than hearts or thumbs ups, we decided to implement a "used tag count", which is my attempt at a neutral indicator that visualizes which recipes have been tested repeatedly.<br><br>
                                <em>Another tricky obstacle we discovered after user testing was how to make the Recipe platform feel more peer-to-peer yet still maintain the privacy of the students who post. </em>Again, we really wanted to avoid the toxicity that comes from social media "clout."<br><br>*After user testing, our solution was to simply display the first name of the recipe publisher and their current year of study. Omitting the last name maintained a degree of anonymity and showing their school year helps reinforce that that these recipes are not externally sourced from the web.Furthermore, each individual recipe page, users can view relevant information such as time required to make, serving size, and difficulty level.</p>

                                <p>Obviously, nutrition is highly dependent on the individual and their eating tendencies. Because of that, Carnegie Kitchen allows users to save and share recipes, and access saved videos from the Tips n' Tricks page.</p>

                                <p>Because our research revealed that people don't have a positive outlook on proper nutrition, we designed a video resources feature for Carnegie Kitchen. This page provides practical videos as well as emotion-based videos that explore how food can shape and better one's emotional health. This feature is also meant to challenge existing paradigms about the appearance ideal and help people think about how food enrich their emotional lives.</p>

                                <p>Food has an emotional effect on all of us, especially for vulnerable eaters. Because this emotional influence of eating is often overlooked, we integrated occasional emotional banner check-ins. If Carnegie Kitchen notices that a user has reported feeling down lately, we help them process and respond to their emotions in a non-destructive ways. More specifically, the feature promotes talking to CMU services, watching emotional resources, and viewing an external link to some food memes. :)</p>

                                <p>From our interviews with both students and staff, we recognized a lack of relationship between CMU services. The app has an entire page dedicated to CMU Health Services in hopes of strengthening the relationship between the two parties through access and knowledge.</p>

                                <p>Our ultimate intention for this nutrition app is for university students to equip themselves with long lasting physical and emotional tools that will guide them past their time in school. The point of this app isn't just to provide a convenient dining calendar or recipe page; it's to help frame a more positive dialogue around what food culture should be like. We understand that nutritional health is something that may never be perfected, but we believe that it's something that can be worked on.</p>
