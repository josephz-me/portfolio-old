                            <p>Over the course of two weeks, I dug deep into the context and mission of Pittsburgh Arts & Lecture with the intent of designing an event poster for their New and Noted lecture series. After initial research and conversation with staff, I developed this mission statement:</p> <br><br>
                            <i>"Pittsburgh Arts & Lectures endeavors to inspire curious ideas and experimental thinking by connecting wildly diverse authors with passionate readers."</i>
                        </div>
                    </div>

                        <div class='right'>
                            <p> On September 5th, I went to one of their events highlighting renowned editor and author Jeff Gordinier. At this event, Jeff talked about his book Hungry, a four-year travelogue talking about his experiences following one the most celebrated chefs in the world, Rene Redzepi. Below is an image of the Carnegie Lecture Hall, where the event occurred. Though the image looks a bit dark and lonely (blame camera quality), the atmosphere inside the room filled with curiosity and question immediately upon Gordinier and the chat hosts walking on stage. There are were about 60–100 people, many sitting behind me. The age range for this specific event revolved around 35–70 years old, but after talking to staff, I learned that different events can vary widely depending on the author and topic.</p>

                    <div class='text-wrap'>
                        <div class='right'>
                            <p>Through my experience attending this event, I learned that the conversation, yes, is about the book and its narrative, but its more so about the author and his life changing experiences described in the book. It’s about the meta realizations that come from wild adventures and the transformation in thoughts that follow. I learned that Pittsburgh Arts and Lecture is about inspiring curiosity. It’s about sharing audacious moments and how those experiences can help others better broaden their perspective on the world. With this in mind, I began the visual exploration process.

                        <h4>03 Type Explorations</h4>
                        <p>To begin, I started experimenting with weight and proximity in type. Given various limitations for a number of exploration exercises, we utilized the principles of visual hierarchy to cluster type together as well as divide it.</p>

                        <h4>04 Color</h4>
                        <div class='right'>
                        <p>Upon playing with type, I began exploring how color can influence the way information is conveyed when juxtaposed together. There were two ways to approach my exploration of color — through print and web. <br><br> I think it’s a completely different experience to pull color from print compared pulling it from the web. Both have their respective nuances, such as the manual work necessary to color sample from magazines which makes decisions a bit more calculated. In contrast, the web has a lot more sources when it comes to inspiration, making the process more about an extremely broad exploration than anything else.</p>

                            <p class='right'>After taking a step back, I noticed that a lot of what I picked out involved vibrant hues contrasted against bold blacks and whites. I knew the color direction I was going was probably pretty reflective of my personal design preferences, not necessarily what fit Pittsburgh Arts & Lectures the best. I kept this very consciously in mind as I continued my further explorations.
                            <br><br>
                            Given a series of color exercises, I began playing with the situating of color with type, as well as manipulating the type color itself.

                            <p>Rather than use Apple's iOS Human Interface and Google's Material Design, I wanted to brand the app to appear and feel different. This led to changes a few intentional design decisions.</p>

                        <p>Upon finishing research, I began sketching with pen and paper, eventually developing a more refined and accurate digital wireframe. One thing I kept in mind was the importance of minimalism and simplicity. I wanted to make sure that the user would have no confusion figuring out what's meant to be informative/visual and what's meant to be interactive.</p>

                            <h4>09 Reflection</h4>
                            <p>In conclusion, the entire process of designing this concept app allowed me to exercise a multitude of design practice skills. From data collection to wireframe building, visual graphics, and product presentation, individually embarking on designing an app as simple as "Focus" has taught me the unseen complexity of product design. If I had more time on this project, I would attempt to fully prototype the app and implement transitional animations, enhancing the user's spatial experience and intuition regarding navigational flow.
