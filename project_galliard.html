                            <p> For both these projects, my mission was to paint Gallird in a fresh perspective that would reveal its high potential as a highly versatile typeface. Over the span of four weeks, I dove into the history and stylistic traits of the Galliard typeface to design: <br>

                            <h5>Research</h5>
                            <p>Before any handling of text, I researched the story of Galliard and its historical context. Some key takeaways I got from my research was that Galliard was a form of Renaissance dance and music popular all over Europe in the 16th century. The typeface was designed to be a reflection of that time period’s culture, which can really be seen through its structural qualities. With my gathered research, I developed / wrote out a first draft summary describing the history and significance of the typeface.</p>
                            <br><h5>Takeaways</h5>
                            <p>Through this research process, I discovered that though the font’s roots originated hundreds of years ago, it was only recently redesigned in 1978, making it relevant for both digital and print mediums. This meant that Galliard was designed to have historical print intentions but utilized in a present world with new technologies.

                        <h4>02 Typesetting</h4>
                        <p>To gauge readability sizes and fonts, I printed out the content I wrote on a series of pages, each having a different leading and font size. The goal of this process was for me to better visualize how a variety of settings might vary on screen verses physically on paper.</p>

                            <p>With enough context of Galliard’s history and usage, I began exploring the type setting — how to display text on a page. In the next series of spread, I kept color and image variables constant, and began playing with various layout formations.</p>

                        <p>I started off with word dumping things that I associated with Galliard.

As quite an elegant font, I wanted to depict Galliard in that respective light, surrounded by iconic symbols of history and culture.</p>

                            <p>Regarding typography choice, I always wanted to somehow juxtapose serifs and san serifs together on this spread.

                        <h4>02 Wordstorming</h4>
                        <p>In the previous project, I had already researched the history and formal structure of the typeface. However, transferring mediums from static print to digital motion graphics prompted me to word-storm and better define what traits really defined Galliard. I consciously tried to focus on traits that were physical or tangible in some way. Some of the words I pulled out were elegant, calligraphic, majestic, sensuous, and intricate.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class='spacer'></div>

                    <div class='text-wrap'>
                        <div class='right'>
                                <p>At this end of this session, I detailed out two directions to pursue:
                                        <br><br><i>1) Emphasis on Galliard’s culture and history</i>
                                        <br><i>2) Focus on Galliard’s typographical form and physicality</i><br> 
                                        <br>The first option would depict the typeface in a more proper and traditional context where much of the content would hone in on Galliard’s designers and road to development. The second route would highlight Galliard’s elegance as a serif font with its sophisticated forms. <br><br>The ideal path for me would have been to merge these two directions into one, but a big problem was the fact that Galliard is a very classical dance and if I were to portray the typeface in that light, it would ultimately restrict the stylistic direction I coudl take the typeface. At the end, I decided to focus on the structural form of Galliard and it’s defining traits.</p>

                            <p>Though I wanted to place the animation’s focus on Galliard’s form-based traits, I still wanted some references to its Renaissance roots. I pulled color inspiration through both physical sampling and digital sample.

                            <p>Through this broad exploration process, I realized that Renaissance colors hold a muted character to them. At the end I pulled out three high potential colors:</p>

                                    <p>For this initial step, my primary goal was blocking out structural positioning for the text rather than developing out the details and micro-interactions.</p>

                                <p>I then transferred my work onto Adobe Illustrator where I began playing with higher fidelity flows. This was also the phase where I began splash testing colors to see how they would express themselves as an overall narrative. From there, I jumped into Adobe After Effects and began prototyping initial interactions.</p>

                                <p>As I went, I constantly updated my storyboard to fit the narrative arc and ultimately the music. Below is a higher fidelity storyboard of my entire animation.</p>

                                <p>I eventually built up 60 seconds worth of animation and decided to consult peers and mentors about their initial experiences with the video. Below are some takeaways I pulled from my conversations.</p>
                              
                                <br><br><h5>Color</h5>
                                <p>- Possibly introduce an additional second color to compliment the purple
                                <br>- Experiment with other shades.
                                <br>- Commit to either representing the classical history or focus on complimenting the music choice.</p>
                             
                                <br><h5>Clarity & Simplicity</h5>
                                <p>- Simplify verbal language
                                <br>- Work on timing → some phrases aren’t given enough time</p>
                                
                                <br><h5>Audience Takeaways</h5>
                                <p>- Simplify verbal language
                                <br>- I have so many elegant transitions and animations but how do I draw attention to the content, to the meat of the animation?
                                <br>- I want them to leave with a impactful emotional response, but it’s also important that the audience receives key learning points from the video.</p>

                                <p>In this version, I refined a few things. I brought up the saturation on the purple to make it bolder and fit the music better. I introduced a gold spot color to compliment the purple to better convey royalty and elegance. Finally, I simplified my textual language on many of these pages.</p>
