                            <p> In this project, my team and I researched and explored Pittsburgh's waste management system. Working in a team of six, we dissected and mapped out the city's flow of waste and the social-technical problems present within the system's existing processes.</p>

                            <p>Throughout this process, we refined our complex map with the intent of eventually designing an intervention that would alleviate the issues within the waste management system. To do so, we utilized futures design thinking: that is: <br><br>
                            1) Mapping out what the current situation and features that are dominant / dormant.<br>
                            2) Projecting the best case scenario of what Pittsburgh would be like if all issues were solved.<br>
                            3) Tracing back from the projected scenario to the graph's middle point, that is how we can potentially bridge the present and the future.</p>

                        <p>With much of the research done, our team of five began mess mapping the waste management system on Kumu, a collaborative idea mapping platform.

                        <h5>Target Users</h5>
                        <p><em>Our intervention focused on the university ecosystem, specifically targetting undergraduate and graduate student in Carnegie Mellon.</em> We wanted to target the age range of 18-25, because eventually, these individuals would be the policymakers and leaders of the next generation. Though we're targeting Pittsburgh's young adult demographic, we designed these interventions to be adaptable to any campus community. This meant implementing a system that:</p>
                         <br><br>
                            <i>1) Brought awareness through live personal + all-campus statistics
                            <br><br>2) Used gamefication to incentivize healther usage/disposal of certain materials depending on the type of trash they threw away.
                            <br><br>3) Educated students on consumer materials and their respective ecological footprint.</i>
                        <br><br>
                        <p>This led us to develop two interventions that function separately but harmonize when used together. <em>The first is an app called GreenMellon, which visualizes all-campus disposable statistics, gamefies the trash disposal experience, and monitors your own personal weekly / data waste habits.</em>
                            
                        <br><br><em>The second is an interactive product labels for on campus-sold products. These labels are geared towards increasing curiousity and awareness of ecological impact.</em></p>

                                <br><br>We also decided to hide the ecological impact information unless users wanted to reveal it. This is done to minimize counterproductive guilt that might build and possibly lead to intentional ommitted submissions.

                                <p>In addition to encouraging higher engagement through gamefication of the waste disposal experience, we also targeted students and their lack of awareness regarding what they were throwing away daily. To compliment the app's QR scanner functionality, we designed informative sticker labels that:</p>
                                <br><i>1) Indicate the harzardous level scale of that material</i>
                                <i>2) Provides a QR Code that takes users to more detailed info</i>
                                <i>3) Shows the # of years that material will take to decompose</i>

                                <br><br><h5>Goal</h5>
                                <p>Designing an intervention pertaining to on-campus goods is one of the most direct ways for us to reach the student body simply because so many individuals come in contact with these products. <em>Our goal for this intervention is for individuals to realize that not only are these plastic bottles, cardboard packages, and rubber goods things that we consume, but also things that we return back into the environment.</em>

                                <p>Given three weeks to research, gigamap, and design an intervention, we were extremely restricted on how far we could take this project. Through this process I learned how to synthesize and sift through large amounts of information and isolate key problems. If I had more time on this project, I would dive into deeper UX research for our proposed interventions.
