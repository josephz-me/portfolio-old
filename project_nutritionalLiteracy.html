                            <p>As second year CMU students who love food and prioritize our wellbeing, we wanted to better understand the lack of nutritional literacy among CMU students . Our curiosity lead to the question of:</p>
                            <br><br>
                            <i style='color:#47b46d;'>“How might we improve nutritional literacy among Carnegie Mellon students in regards to both on-campus and off-campus dining?”</i><br><br>

                            <h5>Design Process</h5>
                            <p>
                            Throughout these 8 weeks, my team and I divided our research and design process into three primary categories:
                            </p>
                        </div>

                    <div class='text-wrap'>

                            <h5>Problem</h5>
                            <p>Throughout our time at CMU, we have noticed the lack of nutritional resources surrounding CMU’s dining options. There are a few CMU digital and physical platforms dedicated to promoting nutritional wellbeing (e.g. dining calendars, nutritional calculator, Health Services). While these resources exist, they are scattered across multiple platforms making it inconvenient to access them regularly.
                            <br><br>
                            As a result, students don’t take advantage of what CMU provides and are ill-equipped to achieve a balance between health and academics. Many are constantly stressed, unhappy, and unaware of how they can use food to improve their wellbeing.</p><br><br>

                            <h5>Solution</h5>
                            <p>Carnegie Kitchen, a nutrition app that subtly encourages behavior changes by integrating habit-building nudges with practical dining functions.</p>

                            <p>To unpack the stakeholders involved in our problem space, we mapped out our stakeholders, the relationships between them, and any hierarchy in the system. . Then, we started to categorize stakeholders based on whether they were internal or external in regards to CMU. From doing so, we realized that some stakeholders don’t fit into a specific category and should be treated flexibly. Deepening our understanding of our stakeholders revealed to us the wide scope of participants in the CMU food ecosystem.</p>

                                <p>To synthesize our research on students’ relationship to nutrition, we grouped responses by how high students ranked their prioritization of health. Overall, the majority had misconceptions about what it meant to have a positive relationship with food. Furthermore, many students didn’t care about their nutrition and for those who did care, they felt a lot of negativity and guilt when it came to being “healthy”. Many responses revealed a common hyperfocus on specific measures of nutrition (e.g. protein levels, fats) rather than looking at nutrition from a holistic perspective.</p>

								<p>Through diary studies, my collaborators and I tracked what seven students ate everyday for a week.

Visually mapping the survey responses reaffirmed our finding that the most influential factors in how students decided on a dining option were location, convenience, and preference/taste.</p>

                            <p>From this survey, we found that people tended to be frustrated with the convenience of getting their food as much of the lack of nutritional information provided onsite. Many also felt like there weren’t enough cultural foods familiar to their background. All these frustrations contributed to an overall lack of trust in CMU Dining's ingredients and kitchen services.</p>

                            <p>Using the responses as a guide, we affinity mapped all our previous research into primary concerns expressed by students. This final survey reemphasized themes such as the significance of convenience. Another valuable insight was people's perception of food as binary in relation to physical appearance (eating “bad” food will make me “fat,” etc.), and the emotional baggage tied to that. Using our findings, we began listing out useful app features that could address each category of concern.</p>

                                <i style='color:#47b46d;'>
                                01 / Living Dining Calendar<br><br>
                                02 / Pre-order System<br><br>
                                03 / Recipe Exploring + Sharing<br><br>
                                04 / User Profile Hub<br><br>
                                05 / CMU Health Services<br><br>
                                06 / Emotional Check-ins</i><br><br>

                                <h5>Live Dining — Calendar</h5>
                                <p>The primary function for this app is the live dining calendar for on-campus restaurants. This already exists on CMU’s website as well as on a student-built site called CMU Eats, but the issue right now is a lot of valuable information on CMU dining is inaccessible because of how it is scattered across various digital services.<br><br>

                                This feature is important to the app because it’s the practical feature that will keep students consistently using the app, and ultimately lead them explore our more emotional features. From this page, users are able to explore individual dining locations and view individual restaurant items.</p>

                                <h5>Live Dining — Nutrition Facts</h5>
                                <p>Viewing nutrition facts can contribute to obsessive nutrient tracking behaviors, so we implemented a precautionary barrier that requires users to watch an educational awareness video before accessing the nutrition facts.</p>

                                <h5>Living Dining - Preorder System</h5>
                                <p>One of the biggest priorities we found among students was convenience and time. Introducing a pre-order system addresses this concern and creates a more efficient, stress-free dining experience for students.</p>

                                <h5>Recipe Page</h5>
                                <p>For people who sometimes or fully eat off campus, we added a recipe viewing and sharing aspect. We didn’t, however, want to create a social media platform where the number of likes dictates the user’s emotional state, so you can simply save recipes, but not see the quantity of saves. Because eating can be such an individual experience, we strived to maintain privacy while inspiring a positive community around nutrition. On each individual recipe page, users can view relevant information; such as time required to make, serving size, and difficulty level.</p>

                                <h5>User Profile Page</h5>
                                <p>Obviously, nutrition is highly dependent on the individual and their eating tendencies. Because of that, Carnegie Kitchen allows users to save and share recipes, and access saved videos from the Tips n' Tricks page.</p>

                                <h5>Tips N' Tricks</h5>
                                <p>Because our research revealed that people don't have a positive outlook on proper nutrition, we designed a video resources feature for Carnegie Kitchen. This page provides practical videos as well as emotion-based videos that explore how food can shape and better one's emotional health. This feature is also meant to challenge existing paradigms about the appearance ideal and help people think about how food enrich their emotional lives.</p>

                                <h5>Emotional Check-ins</h5>
                                <p>Food has an emotional effect on all of us, especially for vulnerable eaters. Because this emotional influence of eating is often overlooked, we integrated occasional emotional banner check-ins. If Carnegie Kitchen notices that a user has reported feeling down lately, we help them process and respond to their emotions in a non-destructive ways. More specifically, the feature promotes talking to CMU services, watching emotional resources, and viewing an external link to some food memes. :)</p>

                                <p>From our interviews with both students and staff, we recognized a lack of relationship between CMU services. The app has an entire page dedicated to CMU Health Services in hopes of strengthening the relationship between the two parties through access and knowledge.</p>

                                <p>This project taught me so much in terms of time management, collaborative sensemaking, and the UX methoddology. <em>Though this project was carried out in an academic setting, EVERY aspect of the design process was self-facilitated.</em> Given the two restrictions of bettering the CMU community in the span of 8 weeks, we were the ones who structured our project timeline, chose our research methods, and carried out the final implementations. If we had more time for this project, we could create higher fidelity wireframes and potentially pitch our concept to the Carnegie Mellon Health and Dining staff.</p>
