                            <h5>Problem</h5>
                            <p>As students passionate about healthy living, we noticed the lack of nutritional information surrounding CMU’s dining options. There are a few CMU digital and physical resources dedicated to nutritional convenience / wellbeing (ex: dining calendars, nutritional calculator, health services). While these resources exist, these resources are scattered across multiple platforms making it inconvenient to access them on a regular basis.
                            <br><br>
                            As a result, students don’t take advantage of what CMU provides, resulting in an inability to achieve a good balance between health and academics at CMU. Many are constantly stressed, unhappy, and unaware of how they can use food to improve their wellbeing.</p><br><br>

                            <h5>Solution</h5>
                            <p>Carnegie Kitchen, a nutrition app that subtly encourages behavior changes by integrating habit-building nudges with practical dining functions.</p>

                            <p>Though we had begun to list out the main stakeholders involved in our problem space, we fleshed out the relationships and hierarchy within possible other stakeholders through information mapping. After continuing to unpack stakeholders (like students), we started to categorize them based on whether they were internal or external in regards to CMU. From doing so, we realized that some stakeholders don’t  fit completely in one category and should be treated more flexibly. Flushing out this stakeholder map revealed to us the wide scope of different participant in the CMU food ecosystem.</p>

                                <p>Overall, the majority had some sort of misconception about what it means to have a positive relationship with food. Furthermore, many people didn’t care about their nutrition and for those who did care, they felt a lot of negativity/guilt when it came to being “healthy”. Many also reported that they felt hyper focused on certain measures of nutrition rather than looking at nutrition from a holistic perspective.</p>

								<p>Over the course of seven days, my collaborators and I tracked our eight student's diets plus ourselves. We documented details such as, type of food, reason of choice, and satisfaction. We found that convenience and preference played the biggest role in dining decisions across almost every meal. It didn't matter how much a dish was desired, if it was cold outside and far to walk to, individuals didn't go.</p>

After mapping the survey points visually, we realized that the biggest factors, again were location, convenience, and preference of taste.</p>

                            <p>From this survey, we found that people tend to be frustrated with the convenience of getting their food as much of the lack of nutritional literacy. Many also feel like there aren't enough cultural foods that are familiar to how they eat back at home. There was an overall lack of trust in CMU Dining's ingredients and cooking practices.</p>

                            <i>"What stresses you out about food?"</i><br>
                            <p>From these responses, we hoped to categorize all our previous research into the primary concerns given by students. This final survey revealed to us again a themes such as the significance of convenience. Another valuable insight was people's perception of food as binary in relation to physical appearance (eating “bad” food will make me “fat,” etc.), and the emotions tied to that. Using this information, we began listing out useful app features that would cater towards each category</p>

                                            <h5>Live Dining — Calendar</h5>
                                            <p>The primary function for this app is the live dining calendar for on-campus restaurants. This already exists on CMU’s website as well as on a student-built site called CMU Eats, but the issue right now is a lot of valuable information on CMU dining is scattered across the web and across various digital services. <br><br>

                                            This feature is important to the app because it’s the practical feature that will keep students consistently using the app, and ultimately lead them to our more important features, which will be discussed later.
                                            From this page, users are able to explore individual dining locations and view individual restaurant items.</p>

                                            <p> Viewing nutrition facts can contribute to obsessive nutrient tracking behaviors, so we designed the app to utilize a precautionary educational barrier that asks you to watch a awareness video before accessing macro tables.</p>

                                            <p>One of the biggest priorities we found among students was convenience and time. Introducing a pre-order system addresses this concern, ultimately helping students have a more stress-free and efficient day.</p>

                                                We didn’t, however want to create a social media platform, so you can simply save recipes, but not see the quantity of saves- didn’t want to contribute to the negative aspects of social media and nutrition, all about maintaining privacy, but creating a community at the same time. On each individual recipe page, users are able to view crucial information relevant to the recipe.</p>

                                            <p>Obviously, nutrition is highly dependent on the individual and their eating tendencies. Because of that, Carnegie Kitchen allows users to save and share recipes, and access saved videos from the Tips n' Tricks page.</p>

                                            <p>Because our research revealed people don't have a healthy outlook on what properly nourishing oneself means, we designed Carnegie Kitchen to have a video resources page. This page provides practical videos that include emotion-based videos to establish the role nutrition and foods play in shaping one's emotional health. This feature is also meant to help people to move from thinking of food in terms of appearance to nutrition as a way of improving mental wellbeing.</p>

                                            <p> Food has an emotional effect on all of us, especially for vulnerable eaters. Because this aspect of eating is often overlooked, we integrated occasional emotional banner check-ins. If the app notices that a user has been feeling down lately, we help them process and respond to their emotions in a non-destructive ways, such as talking to CMU services, watching emotional resources, and an external link to some food memes. :)</p>

The app has an entire page dedicated to CMU Health Services in hoeps of building a stronger relationship between the two parties through access and knowledge.</p>
