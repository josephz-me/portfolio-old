                            <p>This summer, I was given the opportunity to join Elevation Church's Digital Team and collaborate with a diverse team of designers, developers, and data analysts. Throughout my 3 months in North Carolina, <em>I had the privilege of embarking on various projects such as researching, prototyping, and creating the initial vision for Elevation tvOS app, as well as relaunching Elevation Connection Center, a digital platform for people to get connected through small groups, volunteering, and baptisms.</em> Every week, I also gained insight and personal development teachings by leaders from Elevation's various departments (production, finance, creative, etc).</p><br><br>

                            <p>Elevation Church is a global ministry with a weekly attendance of 26,000 people across 18 physical locations, as well as a massive <a href='https://www.youtube.com/user/ElevationOnline' target='blank'>online streaming</a> and <a href='https://www.instagram.com/elevationchurch/?hl=en' target='blank'>social media</a> presence. The ministry is also home to the Grammy-nominated music group <a href='https://www.youtube.com/user/elevationworship' target='blank'>Elevation Worship</a>. Being able to be a part of Elevation this summer has not only given me experience with project management and UX design tools, but also insight on what it means to collaborate in a creative atmosphere with right-brained engineers who think in ways a designers usually does not.</p>

                            <p>Elevation Connection Center (CC) is a digital platform for people to get connected with the Elevation community through joining/leading small groups (eGroups), volunteering (eTeams), and Baptisms. As a design team we deconstructed and rebuilt the existing Elevation CC into a platform that better encouraged people to take their next steps of engagement and relational investment.</p><br><br>

                            <h5>Problem</h5>
                            <p> At the time, the <em>Connection Center failed to embody the transparency, clarity, and friendliness that Elevation Church is known for. </em> The site presented input forms in overwhelming and intimidating ways and users were asked to input large amounts of information with no suggestion of what it was going to be used for. </p>
                        </div>
                    </div>

                                <h5>Goal</h5>
                                <p> Our goal was to make the sign up process for eGroups, eTeams, and Baptism as welcoming and convenient as possible. Our big question was, <em>"From start to finish, how do we make this experience feel less like an obligation and more like an invitation?"</em></p><br><br>
                                <h5>Unique Use Cases</h5>
                                <p> Users have three primary ways to access Elevation CC: (1) People who attend Worship Experiences on Wednesday, Saturday, and Sunday can walk up to onsite tents set up for newcomers and those interested in getting involved. (2) Those browsing Elevationchurch.org can access CC through the website's subpages. (3) Finally, there are users who might be exposed to Elevationchurch.cc by a friend, which ultimately skips the explanations provided by the website and onsite church volunteers. By consciously noting the various ways that people engage with Elevation CC, <em>we realized that we needed to redesign CC so that it could somehow stand alone as its own entity and also act as a transition point from somewhere else.</em></p>

                            <h5> Interviews + User Feedback</h5>
                            <p>Before making any initial design decisions, the team wanted to get a better feel of people's impressions with the current UI. Below are some of the takeaways we got:</p><br>
                            <i>01 / Unpolished UI is contributing towards trust issues.</i>
                            <i>02 / New users are confused with Elevation's terminology</i>
                            <i>03 / Long list of filtering options feels quite overwhelming</i>
                            <i>04 / Users aren't sure of why their inputting certain information</i><br>
                        </div>
                    </div>

                        <div class='right'>
                            <h5>Current User Flow</h5>
                            <p> To better understand the existing bone structure of Elevation CC, the team and I mapped out the user flow of each sign up process. From doing so, we realized that 80% of each process was the same. This meant that the bulk of the issues in all (eTeams, Baptisms, eGroups) came from a lack of clarity in these series of actions.

                            <h5>Redesigned User Flow</h5>
                            <p>Upon revaluating and digging into the existing flow, <em>we decided to implement a new sign up experience that uses a checkpoint system to help minimize the number of steps required for returning users interested in Baptisms, eTeams, and eGroups</em> <br><br>The process first asks for a phone number followed by a verification code. The request for the phone number serves both as a security caution as well as the first piece of information to look up. If there are multiple existing entries for the phone number, or if it's not found at all, the user is asked for a second piece of information and the process continues. If the invidual inputs their phone number, verifies the code, and the system finds a user match, then the process ends there and an "Is this you?" confirmation page comes up. That existing user no longer has to redundantly input his/her name, email, and address.</p>

                            <p>The design team redesigned these pages with the goal of bringing more personality and light-heartedness to the process. This prompted us to introduce colored navigation, leader profiles, and an expandable map interface. . .</p><br>

                            <p>Though a list search of eGroups would get the job done, we couldn't help but ask:</p>
                            <br>
                            <i>"What if someone wanted to an find eGroup that fits their preferences AND is close to where they live?" </i>
                            <br>
                            <p>CC 2019 gives users the ability to transition from list view to map view, giving them the option to search eGroups by proximity via city or zip code.</p><br>

                            <p>To avoid the problem of feeling overwhelmed, we designed the process so that users to proceed one step at a time. A big problem in the past Connection Center was the formidable sensation of seeing a page load with ten mandatory input boxes. By breaking it into steps, we were able to solve that issue as well as skip any uncessary steps for returning users.</p><br>

                            <p>For those interested in joining eTeams and getting baptized, Elevation requires individuals to go through an in-person Meet & Greet. As a design team, we pushed to build a universal process that would allow the data team to easily keep track of those that participant in the church. With that goal in mind, we designed the Baptism and eTeam expereince to be almost identical to the process that a person interested in eGroups would go through, just with the additional Meet & Greet sign up page. </p><br>

                            <p>Tackling the UI layouts for mobile allowed us to easily adapt the designs for tablet (and desktop) view. Referring back to the various use cases and possible journey maps, Kiosk Mode is solely intended to be used at an onsite Elevation location. <em>Given that large numbers of people line up after weekend Worship Experiences to get connected, our goal for Kiosk Mode was to be as efficient and distraction-free as possible.</em> After a series of one-on-one conversations and a couple team meetings, we realized we needed to:<br><br>
                                <i>01 / Minimize UI graphic visuals</i><br><br>
                                <i>02 / Simplify necessary sign up steps at kiosk tables.</i><br><br>
                                 All irrelevant UI components are removed, which includes the web app's navigation bar and page footers. </p>

                                <p>As 1 of 3 designers on the Digital Team, we handed off all designs within a one week timeframe. One of the most valuable moments from working on Elevation CC was the opportunity to sit in with developers and walk step by step through every part of the process. It was in these moments that I began to understand what it meant to work "collaboratively". Not just with fellow design students on hypothetical prototypes, but on tangible products that have a deadline to be shipped.<br><br>
                                For future launches, the Digital team has talked about possible integrations with myElevation, Elevation Church's personal user profile platform. This would allow users to potentially leverage Connection Center and myElevation to not only plug themselves into eGroups, Baptisms, and eTeams, but also possibly connect with others in their area in a social-media-esque fashion. Elevation Church exists so that people far from God will be raised to life in Christ and that's what we geared Elevation CC to do.</p>

                            <p>When I came on, the team was in the process of an extremely tight deadline to fully code and develop the site. Throughout the next week, our team worked on building, auditing, and refining Elevation's website. My primary role consisted of user testing the site through each iteration and documenting CSS styling issues, functionality problems, and building certain pages through WordPress Gutenberg.
