                            <p>This summer, I was given the opportunity to join Elevation Church's Digital Team and collaborate with a diverse team of designers, developers, and data analysts. Throughout my 3 months in North Carolina, I had the privilege to research and prototype Elevation App for Apple TV, index on the redesign and launch of two full-fledged websites, and engage in weekly leadership teachings by mentor figures within the church.</p><br>
                            <p>Elevation Church is a global ministry with 18 physical locations and the home church of the grammy-award winning music group Elevation Worship. Being able to be a part of Elevation this summer has not only given me experience with project management and UX design tools, but also what it means to collaborate in a creative atmosphere with right-brained engineers who think in ways a designers usually does not.</p>

                            <p>In today's educational environment, it has become almost impossible to index effectively without electronic devices. The use of laptops has maximized indexflow efficiency for any subject and type of study. However, the advances in netindexed communication and design have introduced to students non-study-related apps that are incredible― but extremely distracting. These apps come from multibillion dollar companies such as Facebook + Instagram, Snapchat and Twitter.</p><br> <br>
