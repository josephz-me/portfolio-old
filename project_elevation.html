                            <p>This summer, I was given the opportunity to join Elevation Church's Digital Team and collaborate with a diverse team of designers, developers, and data analysts. Throughout my 3 months in North Carolina, I had the privilege to research and prototype Elevation App for Apple TV, index on the redesign and launch of two full-fledged websites, and engage in weekly leadership teachings by mentor figures within the church.</p><br>
                            <p>Elevation Church is a global ministry with 18 physical locations and the home church of the grammy-award winning music group Elevation Worship. Being able to be a part of Elevation this summer has not only given me experience with project management and UX design tools, but also what it means to coll    aborate in a creative atmosphere with right-brained engineers who think in ways a designers usually does not.</p>

                            <p>Elevation Connection Center (CC) is a digital platform for people to get connected with the Elevation community through joining/leading small groups (eGroups), volunteering (eTeams), and Baptisms. As a design team we redesigned and transformed Elevation CC into a platform that encouraged people to take their next steps of involvement </p><br><br>

                            <h5>Problem</h5>
                            <p> Currently, the Connection Center's fails to embody the transparency, clarity, and friendliness that Elevation Church is known for. The site presents input forms in overwhelming and intimidating ways and users are asked to input large amounts of information with no suggestion of what it's used for. Furthermore, there's no convenient way for people to go back and revise their inputs. </p>

                                <h5>Goal</h5>
                                <p> Our goal was to make the sign up process for eGroups, eTeams, and Baptism as welcoming and convenient as possible. Our big question was, "From start to finish, how do we make this experience feel less like an obligation and more like an invitation?"</p><br><br>
                                <h5>Unique Use Cases</h5>
                                <p> Users have three primary ways to access Elevation CC: (1) People who attend Worship Experiences on Wednesday, Saturday, and Sunday can walk up to onsite tents set up for newcomers and those interested in getting involved. (2) Those browsing Elevationchurch.org can access CC through the website's subpages. (3) Finally, there are users who might be exposed to Elevationchurch.cc by a friend, which ultimately skips the explanations provided by the website and onsite church volunteers.
                                <br><br>By consciously noting the various ways that people engage with Elevation CC, we realized that we needed to redesign CC so that it could somehow stand alone as its own entity and also act as a transition point from somewhere else.</p>

                            <p>Before making any initial design decisions, I wanted to get a better feel of people's impressions with the current UI. Below are some of the takeaways I got:</p><br>
                            <i>01 / Unpolished UI is contributing towards trust issues.</i>
                            <i>02 / New users are confused with Elevation's terminology</i>
                            <i>03 / Long list of filtering options feels quite overwhelming</i>
                            <i>04 / Users aren't sure of why their inputting certain information</i><br>
                        </div>

                            <h5>Current User Flow</h5>
                            <p> To better understand the existing bone structure of Elevation CC, the team and I mapped out the user flow of each sign up process. From doing so, we realized that 80% of each process was the same. Though the wireframe structure was in reality quite straight forward, the use of misleading signage and  failed to reflect that the tiresome and directionless. TO BE REVISED.

My primary role consisted of user testing the site through each iteration and documenting CSS styling issues, functionality problems, and building certain pages through WordPress Gutenberg.
